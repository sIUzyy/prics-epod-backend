This is the temporary backend of ePOD. I used Express.js for the backend and MongoDB for the database.

Install prics-epod-backend using npm. Make sure you have Node.js, npm, and Git installed on your local machine.

If you don't have Node.js, npm, or Git installed, you can visit the following websites to download them or simply search for installation tutorials on YouTube.

Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en
